# Website Rebuild & Migration (Wix → Custom HTML/CSS)

## Overview
Client website rebuild and migration from Wix to a custom, responsive HTML/CSS solution.

## Goals
- Migrate away from a website builder (Wix)
- Gain full control over layout and styling
- Improve responsiveness across screen sizes
- Produce clean, maintainable HTML/CSS
- Prepare the site for future expansion

## Tech Stack
- Semantic HTML5
- Modern CSS
  - CSS Grid for main page layout
  - Flexbox for components
- No framework
- No JavaScript

## Learning Context
This project was completed as a first real-world client rebuild while actively learning frontend development.
The focus was on applying core layout, responsiveness, and CSS architecture principles in a realistic scenario rather than on advanced features.

## Notes
- Content structure based on the existing Wix website
- Design and layout rebuilt from scratch
- Project scope intentionally limited to HTML/CSS

## Next Steps
- Improve accessibility (ARIA, contrast, semantics)
- Add JavaScript for interactivity if needed
- Optimize assets and performance
