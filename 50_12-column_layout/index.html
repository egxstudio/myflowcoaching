        <h2>For My Love</h2>
        <p>
          This morning is my way of saying: I see you, I choose you, and I’m
          grateful you exist. Not for a perfect Valentine’s — but for a real
          one, made of small details and warm moments. You are my favorite place
          to be.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Three little promises for us</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Presence over perfection</h3>
        <p>
          Today I’m not rushing, not multitasking, not half-there. I want to be
          fully with you — eyes, heart, hands, attention.
        </p>
        <p>You deserve the kind of love that feels calm and certain.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>A soft adventure together</h3>
        <p>
          Even if it’s just a walk, a café, or a sunset, I want us to make a
          tiny memory that belongs only to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          No pressure, no agenda — just “us,” enjoying life. You make ordinary
          moments feel like a scene from a movie.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Words you can keep</h3>
        <p>
          I love the way you think, the way you feel, and the way you move
          through the world with depth and fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          You inspire me to grow, and you make me want to love better. Today and
          every day, I’m on your team.
